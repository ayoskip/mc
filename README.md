# mc 11.22.17 (WIP)

Paired progrommed with fellow cohorts to work on the MORNING CHALLENGE.Objective is to create a simple web application that uses the "fs" and "http modules". Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file. Create a simple lottery game - user can select three numbers out of 50 - if any of their numbers match the random num they win.

Enter three random numbers between 0 and 50 then click play the lottery button.
